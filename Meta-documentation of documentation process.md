# **META-DOCUMENTATION OF DOCUMENTATION PROCESS (docs about the docs)** 

# INTRODUCTION # 
## Product description ## 

This documentation shows how to get started with the process of writing, publishing and designing your first documentation.  
To complete this process, read through the material on this page including a PDF file which is the step-by-step documentation presenting the development of process documentation. 
This documentation is a simple document describing the way how my documentation came to be at a granular level, and helps you achieve the same outputs. I guide you through the whole process of using advanced tools while writing documentation.   
The website describes all tools used in the documentation process as well as all steps which are necessary to do before you start writing. The PDF file is the final product which will support you during the writing process, and is available to download.  

Using this documentation you are able to create your own documentation.  
Now with the introductions out of the way, let’s get started!

# DOCUMENTATION PLAN #
## How my documentation came to be ## 

The first step you should take is the documentation plan outline which presents the roadmap of the project and keeps the track of your process during the realization.  The main steps needed to follow are:

* **PLAN**  When planning your process it helps you to visualize the draft of the final project design. It also improve readability and clarity of your documentation.  
When doing my project I used JIRA to plan my steps in AGILE Project Management.  

* **AUDIENCE**: audience: This step helps you understand who is your audience. You have to define the persona you write to because it defines the target group of users. There are different online tools e.g. https://xtensio.com/how-to-create-a-persona/  which help you to create a persona with all details needed to target the user group and the content. This persona helps technical writers to set the relevant and customized content.

* **STYLE** All documentations are written in a specific style guide. It is a set of standards for writing content which helps maintain a consistent and plain style, voice and tone across your documentation. The style guide also provides general information about grammar and syntax to be used while writing technical documentation.    
I have chosen two styles of writing this documentation; the PDF file is written in more technical way with Google style guide, and the website part is written in Microsoft style guide. 

* **OUTLINE OF TOPICS** This part covers topics, and subtopics in your technical documentation. You should this of a table of contents and try to list  the main sections and subsections that you will write and describe. 


* **TEMPLATE** 
  


# TOOLS FOR DOCUMENTATION # 
Here you can find the list of tools used in this documentation with the short description of its purpose and use.  

General purpose tools
There are countless collaborative tools for software development teams. Those can help to state requirements, share information, and document features and processes:

1. Atlassian Confluence is the most popular collaborative project tool that has the whole ecosystem for managing product requirements and writing documentation. Confluence is known for a stable wiki system and an efficient user story management interface.
2. oXygen + DITA  
Professional tech writers often use specialized software for creating high-quality tech documentation. Such tools are called content management systems, or CMSs, and allow for easier building, organizing, and managing various documentation. A CMS can operate different file formats, import and store content, and let multiple users contribute to content development. 
3. Markdown + GitHub - Github needs no introduction, except for those who want to use it for software documentation. It provides you with its own wiki system and allows for converting your documentation into compelling website showcases.
4. JIRA  The agile method is based on a collaborative approach to creating documentation. If you want to achieve efficiency, interview programmers and testers about the functionalities of the software. Then, after you have written some documentation, share it with your team and get feedback. 
5. Lightshot
6. Hemingway
